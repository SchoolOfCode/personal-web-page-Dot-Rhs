          I'm Rhys, born in Germany but some how ended up in Wolverhampton. I
          make dot work prints and attempt to sell them over instagram, I've
          sold a few shirts and done some artwork for a Japanese Grindcore band
          and a Norwegian PowerViolence band. It's pretty cool to know theres
          people in a few different countries wearing my work or putting it on
          their walls. I also try and keep fit after spending the majority of my
          life playing counter-strike and finding out bunny hopping has no real
          application in the outside world. I do a bit of Thai Boxing, gym and I
          started Bouldering about 5 months ago. Didn't realise how strong I
          wasn't. I've just left my full time job to dive into an intensive full
          stack course with the School Of Code. I'm really nervous as its a jump
          into the unknown, but im more than ready for a huge change in my life
          and I'm excited to start!
